# How has policy discourse changed over time?

## Description
This is a final project for the Computational Content Analysis class. We intend to study the policy discourse of one selected topic over time to examine similarites and differences over time on twitter. We also compare these patterns with that seen in the newspaper, a different medium of policy communication before social media became prevalent.

## Data
* Twitter Data from 2010 to 2019
* COCA corpus - Newspapers
